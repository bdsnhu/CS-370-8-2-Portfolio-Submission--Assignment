Pirate Treasure Hunter: Deep Q-Learning Agent
My Project Overview:
This project demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning techniques, specifically deep Q-learning, to solve a pathfinding problem. The intelligent agent (a pirate) learns to navigate through a maze to find treasure while avoiding obstacles and optimizing its path.
My Work on this Project and the Code that I Was Given:
The project started with a foundation of code that established the environment and problem structure:

TreasureMaze class: A complete implementation that defines the maze environment, including methods to reset the pirate's position, update states based on movements, calculate rewards, track game status, and identify valid actions.
GameExperience class: A partially implemented class for storing episodes and managing experience replay.
Basic structure for the qtrain function with placeholders and pseudocode for the training algorithm.
Utility functions like format_time for readability in output.

The Code that I Created:
My primary contribution was completing the deep Q-learning implementation.

I Completed the qtrain function with the full Q-learning algorithm, including:

Implementation of exploration-exploitation trade-off using an epsilon-greedy approach.
The Logic for selecting actions based on predicted Q-values.
Episode management and memory storage.
Neural network training processes using experience replay.
Performance tracking with win rate calculations and dynamic epsilon adjustment.


Fine-tuned hyperparameters for optimal learning performance.
Ensured proper integration between the neural network model and the maze environment.

The completed algorithm successfully trains the pirate agent to find the most efficient path to the treasure from any valid starting point in the maze.
Connecting Learning to Computer Science:
What Computer Scientists Do and Why It Matters, is that:
Computer scientists design computational solutions to complex problems that would be difficult or impossible to solve manually. In this project, I experienced firsthand how computer scientists:

Create intelligent systems: By implementing a deep Q-learning algorithm, I developed an agent that can learn from experience without explicit programming for each scenario.
Model real-world problems: The maze pathfinding problem serves as a simplified model for many real-world challenges like routing, navigation, resource allocation, and optimization problems.
Develop adaptive solutions: Rather than hardcoding a specific solution, computer scientists create systems that adapt to changing environments and improve over time.

This work matters because similar approaches can address critical challenges across numerous domains: autonomous vehicles navigating complex environments, supply chain optimization, medical treatment planning, and more. The ability to create systems that learn optimal behaviors from experience represents a powerful paradigm for solving problems where explicit programming is impractical.
How I Approach Problems as a Computer Scientist would be:
This project reinforced my problem-solving approach by:

Understand the environment: I first needed a thorough understanding of the maze structure, the agent's capabilities, and the reward system before implementing a solution.
Break down complex problems: I decomposed the Q-learning algorithm into manageable components (state representation, action selection, reward processing, learning updates).
Leverage existing knowledge and abstractions: I built upon established reinforcement learning principles and neural network architectures rather than reinventing solutions.
Iterative improvement: The agent's performance improved over time through continuous training and parameter tuning.
Empirical validation: I evaluated the solution based on measurable outcomes (win rate, completion efficiency) rather than theoretical perfection.

This approach—analytical decomposition combined with empirical testing—represents the essence of computer science problem-solving.
The Ethical Responsibilities are:
Working on this project highlighted several ethical considerations that extend to my role as a computer scientist:

Transparency: Ensuring that the decision-making process of AI systems can be understood and explained, particularly when deployed in critical applications.
Fairness and bias mitigation: While this project had a straightforward objective function, real-world applications require careful consideration of potential biases in training data and reward structures.
Resource efficiency: Optimizing algorithms to use computational resources efficiently, especially important as AI systems scale and their environmental impact grows.
Safety and robustness: Ensuring that intelligent systems behave reliably even in edge cases or when encountering unexpected situations.
Appropriate application: Understanding the limitations of AI systems and ensuring they're applied only to appropriate problems where their behavior can be validated.

To the end user, I have a responsibility to create systems that are reliable, understandable, and beneficial. To organizations, I must balance innovation with careful consideration of potential impacts and limitations.
My Conclusion is:
This project offered valuable hands-on experience with reinforcement learning and neural networks while reinforcing broader computer science principles. The deep Q-learning algorithm demonstrated how relatively simple principles can produce complex adaptive behaviors when properly implemented. Moving forward, I'll apply these techniques to more complex problems while maintaining awareness of both the technical and ethical dimensions of creating intelligent systems.
